# Space travelers

Planet Earth has reached such a critical point of inconvenience and difficulty that one of the possible solutions to these problems is to embark on a mission 
to explore the confines of the Milky Way. It is for this reason that different countries have joined together to build a ship, in this case called "USS DISCOVERY". 
Now, being an interplanetary ship, a complete navigation system is needed in the ship, based on a database of existing planetary systems, 
clearly with navigation routes between them. With this, not only is it desired to calculate the route with less time from one planet to another, 
but also to know the greatest possible number of civilizations.
